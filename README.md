Data Zip File Location: [UC Irvine Repo](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)


## For this project, I am supposed to do the following:
1. Create a tidy data set 
2. Analysis R Script
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
